# Cyber-Security-BT
A repository of Cyber Security Sydney Bootcamp activities.
This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from my CyberClass.

Most of the scripts used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers. 

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
